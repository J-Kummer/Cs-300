What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
   
The project’s main problem was making a program to read a file and handle the data.
There were specific requirements, like showing outputs in alphanumeric order or loading the file correctly.
My biggest issue was with the file path—it took a while to find the error, but the solution was simple,
I just needed to include the file extension.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
   
I approached the problem by troubleshooting and testing my code frequently.
Understanding the pros and cons of different data structures is important because it helps you choose the best one for your program.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered during the activities or project?
   
When I ran into problems, I researched the issue and looked for common causes.
I also ran the code frequently while working to catch errors early and fix them as I went.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
   
The project showed me the benefits of different data structures.
For example, using a vector would have been easier to code, but a data tree structure made it simpler to sort information efficiently.
It helped me see why planning data structures ahead of time is important to do.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    
I learned how important pseudocode is, especially for larger programs. I also realized the value of naming conventions and  file names, without them, it’s easy to lose track of your code.
This has helped me write code that’s easier to read and maintain. This also makes it easier to expand on, or for others to use.
